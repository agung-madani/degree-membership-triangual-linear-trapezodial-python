# Degree of Membership of Triangular Function, Linear Function, and Trapezodial Function using Python #
This code defines five functions that represent different types of membership functions in fuzzy logic: triangular membership, linear up membership, linear down membership, trapezoidal membership. These membership functions are used to represent the degree of membership of a value in a fuzzy set.

The code includes examples of how to call each function to test it with specific input values. You can modify the input values to see how the degree of membership changes for different values of x and the points that define the membership function.
